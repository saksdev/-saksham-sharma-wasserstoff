Features

Multi-Session Editing: Multiple browser windows or tabs can edit the same document concurrently.
Real-Time Syncing: Changes made in one session appear instantly in all other connected sessions.
User Distinction: Each user is assigned a unique color and name for easy identification.

Project Overview
This project is a real-time collaborative text editor built to demonstrate seamless multi-user editing capabilities. It leverages technologies like WebSocket (or a library like Socket.IO) for real-time communication and a front-end framework (e.g., React) for the user interface. Each user is assigned a distinct color and name to differentiate their contributions in the shared document. The editor is designed to be lightweight and responsive, making it ideal for collaborative tasks.
Tech Stack

Frontend: React (assumed, based on common Vercel deployments)
Real-Time Syncing: WebSocket, Socket.IO, or Firebase (adjust based on actual implementation)
Deployment: Vercel
Styling: CSS or a library like Tailwind CSS (assumed)
