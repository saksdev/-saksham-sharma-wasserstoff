  Component Library and Demo Pages
This project provides a reusable component library alongside demo pages showcasing its usage. The goal is to deliver flexible, scalable, and modular UI components that can be seamlessly integrated into various parts of an application. The demo pages illustrate practical applications of the components in real-world scenarios, such as form handling and ticket generation.
Live Demo

Visit the site to interact with the demo pages (Form and Ticket) and see the component library in action.
Folder Structure
The project is organized to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability:
/src
  /components       # Reusable UI components (e.g., Button, Input, FileUpload)
  /lib              # Business logic, utility functions, and custom hooks
  /pages            # Demo pages showcasing component usage (Form.tsx, Ticket.tsx)
  /assets           # Static files (images, icons, etc.)
  /styles           # Global and component-specific styles
/public            # Public assets (HTML, images)
/README.md         # Project documentation

Components

/components: Contains modular and reusable UI components, such as:
Button: A customizable button with support for disabled states and various styles.
Input: A flexible input field with label, placeholder, and change handling.
FileUpload: A component for file uploads with user-friendly feedback.These components are designed to be easily integrated into any page or project.


/lib: Houses utility functions and custom hooks that power the components and demo pages, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

Pages

/pages: Includes two demo pages that demonstrate the component library’s capabilities:
Form.tsx: A form page showcasing input components, validation, and file upload functionality.
Ticket.tsx: A page that displays ticket details generated from form submissions, reflecting user input like name and email.



How to Use the Components

Install Dependencies:Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
npm install


Import Components:Import the desired components into your project files:
import Button from '../components/Button';
import Input from '../components/Input';
import FileUpload from '../components/FileUpload';


Use Components:Render components with the required props:
<FileUpload label="Upload your file" />
<Button disabled={isDisabled}>Submit</Button>
<Input
  label="Full Name"
  placeholder="Enter Your Full Name"
  name="name"
  value={formData.name}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>



Running the Demo Locally
To run the demo locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/saksdev/-saksham-sharma-wasserstoff.git
cd saksham-sharma-wasserstoff


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Start the Development Server:
npm run dev


Open the Demo Pages:

Demo 1: http://localhost:3000/demo1
Demo 2: http://localhost:3000/demo2Note: The local URLs may vary depending on your project’s routing setup. Check the console output of npm run dev for the correct port.



Evaluation Focus Areas

Real-Time Synchronization Reliability and Performance:

Form interactions (e.g., input updates, file uploads,iteral
The application is highly responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience.


User Attribution and Collaborative User Experience (UX):

Components provide clear feedback (e.g., form validation, submission confirmation).
The Ticket.tsx page reflects user data (e.g., name, email) post-submission, simulating a user-specific output.


User Change Tracking:

User attribution is simulated via unique ticket generation in the demo, displaying user-specific data.
Backend integration (not included in the demo) can enable precise tracking of user changes.


Folder Structure Organization and Scalability Readiness:

The folder structure separates concerns (components, pages, utilities), making it easy to add new components or pages.
The architecture supports scalability for larger applications.


Component and Logic Reusability Across the Codebase:

Components like Button, Input, and FileUpload are reusable across pages and projects.
Shared logic in /lib (e.g., hooks, utilities) minimizes duplication and enhances maintainability.


Code Redundancy Minimization and Clean Architecture:

The codebase follows clean code principles, with modular components and abstracted logic.
Redundancy is minimized through reusable components and utilities, ensuring easy maintenance.
